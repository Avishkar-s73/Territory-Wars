# Territory Wars

A turn-based strategy game for two players built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players compete to either get four pieces in a row or to control the most territory on an 8x8 grid by the time the board is full.

## How to Play

The game is simple to learn but offers strategic depth.

1.  **Objective:** There are two ways to win:
    * **Four-in-a-Row:** Be the first player to align four of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    * **Territory Control:** If the entire board is filled without anyone achieving a four-in-a-row, the player with the largest connected territory wins. Territory is the total number of your pieces that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to each other.

2.  **Gameplay:**
    * The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
    * Player 1 (Blue) and Player 2 (Red) take turns placing one of their pieces on an empty cell.
    * The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.

3.  **Controls:**
    * Click on any empty cell to place your piece.
    * Use the "New Game" button to start a new match while keeping the session scores.
    * Use the "Reset Scores" button to clear the scores for the current session.

## Features

* **Dual-Win Condition:** Offers multiple strategies for victory.
* **Responsive Design:** Playable on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive UI:** Clear indicators for the current player, turn number, and game status.
* **Session Scoring:** Keeps track of wins and losses until the page is refreshed.
* **Game Over Modal:** Clearly announces the winner and the reason for victory (four-in-a-row or territory control).
* **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation is supported for moving around the board and placing pieces.
